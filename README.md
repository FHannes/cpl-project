# Project Comparative Programming Languages

This repository contains all files related to my project for the master class Comparative Programming Languages [H0S01a] at the [KULeuven university](http://www.kuleuven.be/) during the academic year 2015-2016. The goal was to create a specific single-page webapplication, using the reactive (functional) programming language Elm.
